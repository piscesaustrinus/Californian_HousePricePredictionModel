# Californian House Price Prediction Model

## Overview

This project aims to predict house prices in California using machine learning techniques, specifically linear regression. The 1990s dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and focuses on various features such as longitude, latitude, housing median age, total rooms, total bedrooms, population, households, median income, and ocean proximity.

## Key Features and Techniques

- **Linear Regression:** Utilized the linear regression model from scikit-learn to predict house prices based on the given features.
  
- **Feature Engineering:** Transformed the "ocean proximity" feature into boolean values for better compatibility with machine learning algorithms.
  
- **Data Exploration:** Conducted data exploration and visualization to understand the relationships between different features and the target variable.

## File Structure

- **HousePricePredictionModel.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook containing the main code for the house price prediction model.

- **README.md:** This file! Provides an overview of the project, key features, and usage instructions.

## Usage

To run the Jupyter Notebook and explore the project:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:sanskruteaa/Californian_HousePricePredictionModel.git
    cd Californian_HousePricePredictionModel
    ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook HousePricePredictionModel.ipynb
    ```

3. Execute the cells to see the code and visualizations.
